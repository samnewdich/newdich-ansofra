CREATED BY: SAMUEL IDEBI(A senior Software Engineer at NEWDICH TECHNOLOGY)
DESCRIPTION: ANSOFRA IS A FRAMEWORK THAT IS PERFECT FOR DEVELOPING ANY SOFTWARE.
THE NAME ANSOFRA IS AN ACRONYM OF THE PHRASE: ANY SOFTWARE FRAMEWORK(ANSOFRA)
IT FOLLOWS THE CQRS(COMMAND QUERY RESPONSIBILITY SEGREGATION) PATTERN WHICH IS A PERFECT ARCHITECTURE FOR BUILDING ANY SOFTWARE INCLUDING ENTERPRISE APPLICATIONS
IT MAKES MVP FASTER.
ANSOFRA SPEEDS UP DEVELOPMENT BY 60%
SOFTWARES BUILT WITH ANSOFRA FRAMEWORK ARE EASY TO MAINTAIN.
ANSOFRA ALLOWS A .NET DEVELOPER, JAVA DEVELOPER, C++ DEVELOPER TO EASILY GET ON AND EASILY BUILD IN PHP
TO USE ANSOFRA, YOU SHOULD HAVE A SOUND KNOWLEDGE IN CQRS ARCHITECTURE PATTERN.

BELOW ARE SOME DIRECTORIES AND FILES TO UNDERSTAND IN ANSOFRA.
index.php
    is the entry to the framework.
    it contains the autoload, it is where all request land before sending it to route

route
